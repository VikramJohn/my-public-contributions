# Making mate #

This guide isn't a *preparaciones tradicionales*. It's just the way I do it. 
  
**Ingredients**: a *mate* gourd, clean and dry; yerba *mate*; a *bombilla* (I got the one with a wide, spoon-shaped filter at the tip.); a flask (yes, you need one), a kettle and water.  

1. Shake some of the yerba *mate* into your gourd. Some suggest you fill two-thirds of the gourd and others, three quarters. But anything more than halfway will last you through the day if you bought a medium-sized gourd.
2. Next, separate the *mate* into layers of heavier and lighter particles. Clap a hand across the rim to cover it, turn the gourd over and shake it for a few seconds. Imagine you're a *gaucho* with large rope-burn calloused hands and try to affect nonchalant vigour as you throw the *mate* up within the gourd. Or maybe, just do it over the kitchen sink.  
3. Turn the gourd back the right way up, and dust off your hands. Now, pick up the gourd again and shake it more gently from side to side. Roll the pile so that a layer of heavier particles covers the lighter particles. Heap the *mate* against one side of the gourd in a pile that is not too steep. 
4. Stabilize your heap by wetting it with cold water. Place the *bombilla* against it and trickle cold water in along the side opposite the heap. It can be tricky to do this without disturbing the *mate*. Fill about half the gourd with cold water and then carefully tilt the gourd to wet the rest of the pile. 
5. Lift the *bombilla* off the pile and drive its filter's edge carefully into the bottom of the heap so that a part of the spoon-shaped end is buried in a small cleft in the heap. Lean the sipping end of the *bombilla* on the opposite rim. Now, let the *mate* absorb the water and swell around the *bombilla*. The cold water consolidates the heap and slows down the release of mate into the brew. That in turn increases the likelihood that the *mate* in your gourd will last the whole day or at least a few hours.
7. Let the *mate* soak up the water for a few minutes. 
8. Boil some water in your kettle and fill it into your flask.
9. Pour the hot water slowly along the side of the gourd that is opposite the heap. Fill to no more than 3/4th the height of your heap and let it stand for a few more minutes.
10. Drink the first lot of cold, brackish *mate* while you anticipate the mellow bitterness of the second batch. Finish the brew from each servering; you should here the gurgling of air being drawn in when you reach the bottom. Refill water no higher than 3/4th the height of the slope. Guard your mate grourd like your life depends on it and throw a tantrum at anyone who touches it without permit, breathes hard near it, or does anything that can shake or move the *bombilla*.
